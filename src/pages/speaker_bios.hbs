    <p><span>Rev. Marie Onwubuariri</span><br/><img src="{{url}}images/marie.jpg" class="right speakerPic"/>
        Marie self-defines as a 1.75 Filipina-American - born in the Philippines, raised in the U.S.,
        but not quite the same as what society calls a 1.5 gen immigrant (ask her if you want more info!)
        This journey of self-identity emerged for her a passion and calling to be an effective
        intercultural leader, bridging between people of different generations, ethnicities, and walks of
        life. She was raised in an American Baptist church in New York City, and after a career in the
        retail industry she followed God's leading to devote her life to following Christ. Marie comes
        with her ministry experiences as an active lay person, a youth director, a young adult minister,
        a senior pastor, an emerging leader in the American Baptist denomination, and currently loves
        helping people discern their call as the Director of Admissions at the American Baptist Seminary
        of the West in Berkeley. She lives in San Pablo with her husband, two young kids, and beloved dog.
        She enjoys a variety of music, photography, and a good game of volleyball.</p>
